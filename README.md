# Data Analysis Dash App
## Scope
This project aims to build a visualization web app for data analysis. 
- Visualization
- Data Analysis
- Interactive web app
- Generation of research reports

## Dependencies
The web app is built under the frameworks of [Dash and Plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/?_gl=1*1ndvzch*_ga*MTE4OTc0ODE0OC4xNjYzMDYwODEz*_ga_6G7EE0JNSC*MTY2MzA2MDgxMy4xLjEuMTY2MzA2MDgyNi4wLjAuMA..). 
They are both python-native frameworks for web application and data visualization.
One would find out that it is a relatively easy way to build an interactive interface even though one is programming in Python.

Data are populated from a remote database. For instance, [python mariadb](https://pypi.org/project/mariadb/). 

With this interactive data analysis project folder, one could further visualize and analyze. 
Take a look at the [Pythonic IoT project](https://github.com/PeterTsungYu/dev_iot) and [NodeRed Dashboard](https://github.com/PeterTsungYu/flows_Reformer) that are created under the same scope of this project.
